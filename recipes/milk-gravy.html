    <h6>A pot of gravy. No you can't drink it, fatty.</h6>
    <p>
        Biscuits and... C'mon I shouldn't have to tell this. Put away the packet and step into the light, where your breakfast and
        mashed potatoes no longer suck.
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Milk, duh. 32 oz</li>
            <li>1/4 C Flour</li>
            <li>1/4 C butter</li>
            <li>salt</li>
            <li>black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>The Process</h2>
        <ol>
            <li> Add your butter into a hot pot and wait until it's melted</li>
            <li>Add flour to your hot butter and cook, stirring frequently. Not too frequently though, sort of like pushing around
                something questionable floating in a pond. This is called a roux, welcome to cooking. It's done when its darkened in color
                and smells sort of like popcorn.</li>
            <li>Add in your milk and whisk it like it owes you money</li>
            <li>Add in an appropriate amount of salt and pepper, maybe not at the same time if you're a "seperate but equal" kind of person</li>
            <li>Stir frequently on med-high heat until it thickens</li>
            <li>We're done here, why are you still reading? Why am I still typing? Is this even real life?</li>
        </ol>
