    <p>It's tomato sauce. I'm assuming you've had spaghetti before. Or pizza. This is basic life stuff here guys, 
        if you haven't had tomato sauce we can't help you with that here. Go buy a jar of Ragu and some garlic toast and figure it out.
        This will be slighly better than that, even if you completely screw it up.
    </p>
    <h2>The Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>canned diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>Basil</li>
        <li>Oregano</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Garlic-powder, jarred, fresh- don't care</li>
        <li>black pepper</li>
        <li>white sugar</li>
        <li>Optional- Red wine. It adds a nice fruit note and increases depth of flavor, but it will also increase the depth of
            your buzz, you wino. So you pick what's more important.</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Add your tomatoes into your pot, add a little salt at this point.</li>
        <li>Cook the tomatoes until they get extra mushy looking and there's a lot of juice floating around.</li>
        <li>Add your seasonings. (Read- all the other crap in that ingredient list.)</li>
        <li>We season to taste here, so add a bit of all that stuff and come back in an hour or so and taste it.</li>
        <li>Repeat step 4 until you don't hate it.</li>
        <li>take your sauce and run it through something choppy. Food processor, blender, immersion blender, your bootleg dj remixes from high school.
            whatever it takes to get to a smooth consistency.</li>
        <li>Let it simmer for another couple hours, or until you wake up from that bottle of wine you were supposed to put it in the sauce.</li>
        <li>cool it down and store, throw on top of some noodles, add some sausage, I don't know you're game plan here but we're done here</li>
    </ol>
